              <p>And look at us now — living our lives in reverse.</p>
              <p>You’re staying where I used to live, and I’m moving to where you lived. Two siblings swapping locations like we accidentally pressed “shuffle life.”</p>
              <p>And even though we’re distant, you still feel like someone I’d protect, someone I care about more than I ever say, and someone I can tease endlessly because let’s be honest… you are extremely questionable.</p>
              <p>But you’re also kind, talented, soft-hearted, and you deserve the kind of future you dream about.</p>
              <p>Even if you still send me dessert pics just to annoy me. (It’s fine. I send them back.)</p>

                <p>Ayesha,</p>
                <p>for most of our lives we were like two characters in the same book… but on completely different pages.</p>
                <p>You were on one end of the country, I was on the other, and somehow we grew up without really knowing each other.</p>
                <p>But even with that distance, you’ve always had this soft, shy, introverted energy that somehow still manages to send me dessert pics just to make me jealous.</p>
                <p>I don’t know much about your cooking, because you’ve never fed me (rude), but I know you bake, you cook, you draw, and you chase the dream of making a lot of money — which honestly I respect.</p>
